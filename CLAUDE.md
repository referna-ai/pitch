# InTouch Pitch — Claude Instructions

## PR workflow
Before giving a PR link at the end of any task:
1. Check whether the last PR on this repo is already merged: `gh pr list --state merged --limit 1` or `gh pr view <number> --json state`
2. If the previous PR was merged, pull main first (`git checkout main && git pull origin main`), then create a new branch and open a fresh PR for the current work
3. Always give the PR link at the end of the response
4. Always give the Cloudflare Pages preview link too. The bot posts it as a PR comment shortly after the push (look for `cloudflare-workers-and-pages[bot]`); the per-branch URL pattern is `https://<branch-slug>.intouch-short-deck.pages.dev`. If the comment hasn't shown up yet, poll PR comments until it does (or note that the preview is still building).

## Branch naming
Use descriptive kebab-case: `s1-270m-rewrite`, `s4-value-generated`, etc.

## File structure
- `index.html` — root redirect to the active deck version (currently `v4/`). Change the `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` URL to swap.
- `v1/` — original 7-slide deck (index + slide-1…slide-7, plus its own `styles.css`, `nav.js`, `analytics.js`, `copy-deck.js`, `favicon.svg`)
- `v2/` — second iteration deck (same structure as v1)
- `v3/` — 10-slide deck (index + slide-1…slide-10, plus its own assets)
- `v4/` — current 10-slide deck (index + slide-1…slide-10, plus its own assets, including `download-pdf.js`)
- `ab.html` — A/B variant picker
- `scripts/` — server-side code (not deployed as slides)
- `docs/` — internal documentation
- `backup/` — archived versions, do not modify

Each version directory is self-contained — its slides reference its own `styles.css`, `nav.js`, etc. via relative paths.

## Navigation system
See **`docs/navigation.md`** for a full explanation of how navigation works, the three files that must stay in sync, and the common sed double-replace pitfall that has bitten us before.

## Copy HTML button
See **`docs/copy-deck.md`**. The button on each version's `index.html` collects slides via `.deck-tabs .deck-tab` — if you rename that CSS class or restructure the nav, update the selector in every version's `copy-deck.js` (`v1/`, `v2/`, `v3/`, `v4/`) or the button breaks silently.

## Tables: always single-font (Manrope)
The deck uses two type families: `var(--font-display)` (Manrope, sans-serif) and `var(--font-body)` (IBM Plex Serif). They have different x-heights and baselines, so **mixing them inside a single tabular layout** (a `<table>` or any grid/flex "row" pattern with aligned columns — `.channel-row`, `.bni-cheat-row`, `.s5-comparison-row`, `.transform-table`, etc.) makes the columns look misaligned even when the px sizes match.

Rule: every cell in the same table — header, label, value, name, description, sub-line — must use `var(--font-display)` (Manrope). Don't mix Manrope and IBM Plex Serif within one table. Body-font serif is fine for prose blocks (subtitles, paragraphs, quotes, conclusions); just keep it out of tabular layouts.

When adding or restyling a table, audit every `font-family` inside it — including nested cells like `.ai-desc strong`, `.cell-val .val-sub`, etc. — and pin them all to `var(--font-display)`.

## Standardized slide elements
Applies to **both `v3/` and `v4/`** (the active deck versions). Every slide must use the same four elements in the same place, with the same classes and styles. Do **not** restyle them inline or invent new class names — change the canonical rule in the version's `styles.css` if a global update is needed, and mirror the change to the other version unless the divergence is intentional.

DOM order inside `.slide` (top → bottom):
1. `.slide-number` — e.g. `<div class="slide-number">02 / 10</div>` (top-right, absolute)
2. `.slide-label` — eyebrow, e.g. `<div class="slide-label">The professionals</div>`
3. `.slide-title` — `<h2 class="slide-title">…</h2>`
4. *(slide-specific content)*
5. `.conclusion` — `<div class="conclusion">…</div>` (pinned to bottom via `margin-top: auto`)
6. `.sources` — `<div class="sources">Sources: …</div>` (last line, right-aligned)

Canonical styles live in `v3/styles.css` and `v4/styles.css` (line numbers match in both):
- `.slide-label` → lines 72–80 (Manrope 500, 13px, gold, uppercase, `letter-spacing: 0.16em`)
- `.slide-title` → lines 82–90 (Manrope 800, 42px, white, `letter-spacing: -0.02em`)
- `.conclusion` → lines 402–423 (Manrope 700, 24px, gold top border, `→` prefix via `::before`, `<strong>` is gold)
- `.sources` → lines 672–683 (Manrope 11px, `--gray-dark`, right-aligned, faint gold top border)
- Bottom-pinning: `.slide .conclusion { margin-top: auto }` and `.slide .sources { flex-shrink: 0 }` at lines 52–58

Rules:
- Always start the sources line with `Sources: ` (capital S, colon, space). Use `Source: ` only when there is genuinely one source.
- Use `<strong>` inside `.conclusion` for gold emphasis; don't add inline `style=` overrides.
- Per-slide tweaks (e.g. `.slide-title { margin-bottom: 28px }`) belong in a scoped `body[data-slide="slide-N"]` block in that slide's `<style>`, never as inline styles, and never changing color/font/size of the four standard elements.
- When adding a new slide, copy the structure from an existing slide in the same version (e.g. `v4/slide-3.html`) so the order and classes stay identical.

Never override at slide scope (these affect every slide and the bottom-docking depends on them):
- `.slide` flex-column layout and fixed height (`styles.css:40-50`) — changing `display`, `flex-direction`, or `height` breaks the bottom-pinning of `.conclusion` and `.sources`.
- `.slide .conclusion { margin-top: auto }` and `.slide .sources { flex-shrink: 0 }` (`styles.css:52-58`) — these are what pin the bottom two elements.
- `:root` CSS tokens (`styles.css:1-17`) — `--gold`, `--white`, `--gray-dark`, `--font-display`, `--font-body`, `--border`. Don't redeclare them inside a slide's scoped `<style>` block; it silently re-skins that slide and creates drift.

Don't overlap the docked elements:
- `.conclusion` is docked to the bottom with a 2px gold top border + 22px padding-top; `.sources` follows it with a 16px gap, a faint gold hairline, and 12px padding-top.
- Slide-specific content sits above the conclusion's gold rule. Don't let it visually cross or collide with `.conclusion` / `.sources` — if a slide's content runs long, shrink the content (font-size or spacing in the scoped `body[data-slide="slide-N"]` block), don't shrink the conclusion/sources or remove their top borders.
- Don't add `margin-bottom` to `.conclusion` or `margin-top` overrides to `.sources` at slide scope — it breaks the docked spacing.
